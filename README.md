### Hi, I'm Kaz

- I’m currently studying a bachelors of IT (Computer Science Major) at the Queensland University of Technology
- I'm studying two minors: Computational and Simulation Science, and IoT and Mobile Technologies
- So far the programming languages I've used at uni are: C, C#, Python, Java, Matlab, R, and JavaScript (React)

- I'm interested in picking up C++, exploring more low level programming and Machine Learning outside of uni
- I’m always dreaming up too many projects to count. Which includes anything from video games, Raspberry Pi projects, mobile apps/games...

- Fun fact: I use Arch btw
