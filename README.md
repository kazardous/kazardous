### Hi, I'm Kaz

- I’m currently studying a Bachelor of IT with a Computer Science major at the Queensland University of Technology
- I'm studying two minors: Computational and Simulation Science, and a IoT and Mobile Technologies Minor
- So far the programming languages I've used at uni are: C, C#, Python, Java, Matlab, just started: R, and JavaScript through React and node.js

- I'm interested in picking up C++, exploring Machine Learning, and generally improving my programming skills outside of uni
- I’m always dreaming up too many projects to count. Which includes video games, Raspberry Pi projects, a personal mobile app...

- Fun fact: I use Arch btw
